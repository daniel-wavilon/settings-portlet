Specification of JSON objects for Wavilon

## Some notes

_Beautify JSON_

You need some dependencies for python. Run this and tell me what is missing, so that I can do document it.

scripts/beautify_json.sh

And this will produce temporary files with your JSON beautified.

examples/example.json          -> /tmp/beautify_json/examples_example.json

Copy them if you like it.

cp /tmp/beautify_json/examples_example.json examples/example.json

If you are a brave man, you can run:

scripts/beautify_json.sh overwrite

And this will beautify everything for you.
